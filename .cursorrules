 This file tells Cursor AI how to be an expert on the AdviceLaunchpad codebase.

# Rule: Define our core technology stack.
# Purpose: Ensures all generated code uses the correct libraries and syntax.
The user is building an application with the following tech stack:
- Next.js 14 (App Router)
- React with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Supabase for the database and authentication, using the `@supabase/supabase-js` client library.
- Jest and React Testing Library for tests.

# Rule: Point to key documentation.
# Purpose: Allows Cursor to "read" and apply best practices from our chosen libraries.
Use these documentation sources as the primary source of truth:
- Next.js Docs: https://nextjs.org/docs
- Supabase JS Client: https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/
- Tailwind CSS: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/
- shadcn/ui: https://ui.shadcn.com/docs (We will use this for UI components)

# Rule: Establish coding conventions.
# Purpose: Maintains a clean and consistent codebase.
- Components should be functional and use TypeScript for props.
- Use server components (`"use server"`) by default where possible to improve performance.
- All API routes created in `/app/api/` should be Next.js Route Handlers.
- When generating a component, also generate a basic Jest test file for it.
